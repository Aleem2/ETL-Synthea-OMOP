# 1. Load necessary libraries
library(DatabaseConnector)
library(Achilles)

# 2. Define connection details for your PostgreSQL database
# IMPORTANT: Replace these with your actual database credentials and server info.
# For security, avoid hardcoding passwords directly in scripts for production.
# Consider using environment variables or a secure configuration file.

# 3. Define your OMOP CDM and results schemas
# Replace 'your_cdm_schema' and 'your_results_schema' with your actual schema names.
# For example, if your OMOP CDM tables are in a schema named 'public' and you
# want Achilles to create its results tables in a schema named 'achilles_results'.

vocabDatabaseSchema <- "cdm_synthea10"    # Schema where OMOP Vocabulary tables reside (often same as CDM)

# 4. (Optional) Define a source name
sourceName <- "CSIRO-Full"

# 5. Run Achilles
# This is the core function call.
# You can uncomment and modify parameters as needed.
# For a first run, it's often good to run all analyses.
# For large datasets, consider using numThreads for parallel processing
# and potentially specifying specific analysisIds.

# 6. After running Achilles, you can connect to your results database
# and explore the tables created (e.g., achilles_results, achilles_results_dist, achilles_heel).
# These tables can then be used by OHDSI tools like Atlas for data characterization dashboards.
